Build steps for Raspberry Pi
**************************
Step 1:
-----------
1. Set the ARCH and CROSS_COMPILE environment Variables
        $ export ARCH=arm64
        $ export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-

2. Set the PATH to the Cross-Toolchain
        $ export PATH=${HOME}/ela_lab_exercises_rpi/rpi_build/toolchain/gcc-linaro-7.5.0-2019.12-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu/bin/:$PATH

Step 2:
-----------
3. Issue the make command to create the executable binary for target
        $ make
4. use GCC to compile the Host applicaton
	$ gcc -o uart-transmit-host uart-transmit-host.c

Step 3:
-----------
4. Copy the uart-receive-target executable to /root/ of the RootFS
			(or)
5. Ensure both the host and the target are connected to the same network or can reach each other over the network. 
6. On the target machine, you need to find its IP address.
7. From the host machine, use the scp command to copy files to the target machine.
	$ scp uart-receive-target root@10.10.1.27:/root/


Step 4:
-----------
5. Boot the board and go to /root directory

***********************************
Commands to run and test the application
***********************************
1. Give the below command to run the program on target, it will receive the data from UART
        # ./uart-receive-target
2. Give the below command on host to run the host application, it will send the data from host to target via UART
	#. /uart-transmit-host
