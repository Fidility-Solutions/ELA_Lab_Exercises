/********************************************************************************
 * File		: Zombie_Process.c
 *
 * Description	: This file contains a C program demonstrating the concept of a zombie process. A zombie process 
 *              occurs when a child process completes execution, but its exit status has not yet been retrieved 
 *              by its parent process. 
 *              In this program, a parent process forks a child process. The child process immediately exits, 
 *              while the parent process waits for a short time before exiting. 
 *              As a result, the child process becomes a zombie until the parent process retrieves its exit 
 *              status using the wait() system call.
